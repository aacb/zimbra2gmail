# zimbra2gmail

> `zimbra2gmail` is a compiler written in C language; and as a project

## What is zimbra2gmail for?
zimbra2gmail is written to have, as its source files, the Zimbra users
filters; and as its target, the gmail users filters.

Given the gmail users filters as text file, we can use a tool like gam
to apply this filters to gmail. Without a compiler like zimbra2gmail,
this task could be hard work for a single user account; and, me and
my colleagues, we have thousands of accounts to migrate from zimbra
to gmail.

## Usage

It is a project that just started, and is expected to become inactif during
these last days of 2017 (Christmas and New Year). It should be ready to use
in January, 2018.

Anyone can already use this project just as a learning (or teaching) tool
of basic compiler principles.
